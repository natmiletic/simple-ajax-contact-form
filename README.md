<h1>Simple AJAX & PHP Contact Form</h1>

# simple-ajax-contact-form
This is a simple un-stylized contact form using AJAX and PHP (without jQuery). 

I wanted to create something that is simple and reusable. After lots of searching and not being to find anything like this I decided to create my own version. Hope this will help someone and speed up their development project. 

There are lots of improvements that can be made to this since there is little error checking at this time.

Only three files are included:<br>
index.html <- contact form HTML<br>
form.js <- JavaScript code used to generate the request<br>
mail.php <- php file used to mail out the message from the form
